                The Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Museum, located in the heart of Vadodara, has a long history and a reputation
                for being haunted. The museum, which houses the legacy of India's Iron Man, is said to have been built on
                a site that was previously used for dark rituals.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is reported that late at night, strange noises, like footsteps and the sound of moving objects, are heard
                echoing through the museum’s quiet halls. Visitors and staff alike have experienced a cold chill and
                overwhelming feeling of dread in some of the exhibits.
            </p>
            <p>
                One night, I explored the museum when it was completely empty. As I walked past the exhibits, I felt a
                strange sensation of being followed. When I turned, no one was there. But then, I heard footsteps behind
                me—slow, deliberate, as though someone was stalking me in the dark.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I entered one of the exhibit halls, I felt a presence—someone, or something, was there. The lights
                flickered, and I could hear whispers. Many say the spirit of Sardar Patel himself haunts the place, still
                guarding the legacy he left behind.
