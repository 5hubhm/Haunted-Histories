            <p>
                Kirti Mandir, located in the heart of Vadodara, is said to be haunted by the spirits of the past. The temple,
                built in honor of the great leader, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, is a peaceful place during the day, but as
                night falls, a chilling atmosphere surrounds it. Many visitors have reported feeling watched and hearing
                strange whispers when they are alone.
            </p>
            <p>
                I visited the Kirti Mandir one evening, curious about the rumors surrounding the place. As I stood near the
                entrance, the temperature suddenly dropped. The air felt heavier, as though something unseen was present. 
                I heard soft footsteps behind me, but when I turned, no one was there.
            </p>
            <p>
                Faint, hollow voices seemed to echo through the temple's halls. There was no way to explain the strange
                sounds coming from within. People passing by mentioned how they had seen shadows moving within the temple,
                but upon entering, there was nothing but emptiness.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since that night, I haven’t been able to shake off the feeling that the Kirti Mandir is not as peaceful as it
                seems. The spirits of the past still linger, their presence felt in the eerie silence that blankets the area
                after dusk.
