            <p>
                I never thought I'd experience something so chilling in my life. It was late one night when I
                decided to take a shortcut through the back of Metro Hospital in Vadodara. Everyone in the city has
                heard whispers about the sealed building behind the main structure, but I dismissed them as mere
                rumors. That night, however, those rumors came alive.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I passed by, the air grew unnaturally cold, sending shivers down my spine. The building loomed in
                the darkness, its windows dark and uninviting. I paused to gather my courage and that’s when I saw
                it—the elevator in the sealed building was moving. I watched in disbelief as the lights of the
                elevator panel flickered, indicating it was traveling between floors. But how? The building had no
                electricity; it had been sealed off for years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Intrigued and terrified, I moved closer, trying to rationalize what I was seeing. Maybe it was some
                sort of maintenance work, I thought, though deep down, I knew no one would be working there at this
                hour. The elevator came to a stop on the third floor. I swear I saw a shadow pass by one of the
                windows, but when I looked closer, it was gone.
            </p>
            <p>
                The silence around me was deafening. Suddenly, the elevator moved again, this time descending. My
                heart raced as I heard faint whispers, though there was no one around. The stories I had heard about
                this place came flooding back—the ones about a doctor who met a tragic end here and whose spirit is
                said to roam the corridors, unable to find peace.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unable to stand it any longer, I turned and ran, the sensation of being watched growing stronger
                with every step. Even now, whenever I pass by that area, I can’t help but glance at the sealed
                building, half-expecting to see the elevator lights flicker again. They say some places are cursed
                to remain haunted, and after that night, I truly believe Metro Hospital is one of them.
